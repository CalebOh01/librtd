## A simple library to compute return time distances and distributions for genetic sequences.
## 
## ## Basic Usage
## 
## Using `librtd` is as easy as importing it and calling the `returnTimeDistribution <#returnTimeDistribution,string,Positive>`_ function on the desired sequence:
## 
## ```nim
## import librtd
## 
## echo returnTimeDistribution("ATGACAGTA...", k=2) 
## # => {"AA_mean": 43.342, "AA_std": 12.21213, ...}
## ```
## 
## ## Advanced Usage
## 
## `librtd` is not limited to computing the distance from a *k*-mer to its next occurrence.
## Indeed, it can also compute the distance between a *k*-mer and the next occurrence of its reverse complement.
## To do so, you simply need to call `returnTimeDistribution <#returnTimeDistribution,string,Positive>`_ with the `reverseComplement=true` argument:
## 
## ```nim
## import librtd
## 
## echo returnTimeDistribution("ATGACAGTA...", k=2, reverseComplement=true) 
## # => {"AA_mean": 12.432, "AA_std": 1.058, ...}
## ```
## 
## Similarly, `librtd` can compute the pairwise RTD metric, which is just the distance from every *k*-mer to the next occurrence of every other *k*-mer.
## For example, in the sequence `ATGATGA`, the distances from "A" to "T" would be one entry, from "A" to "C", "A" to "G", and so on.
## This is slow, but computes every possible RTD.
## To compute the pairwise RTD, just call `returnTimeDistribution <#returnTimeDistribution,string,Positive>`_ with the `pairwise=true` argument: 
## 
## ```nim
## import librtd
## 
## echo returnTimeDistribution("ATGACAGTA...", k=2, pairwise=true) 
## # => {"AA_AA_mean": 32.373, "AA_AA_std": 15.892, 
## # =>  "AA_AT_mean": 95.12, "AA_AT_std": 21.824, ...}
## ```
## in
## If you are computing both the regular RTD and the reverse complement RTD, for example, you may wish to use the lower level functions instead.
## The higher level `returnTimeDistribution <#returnTimeDistribution,string, Positive>`_ is overloaded such that it can also be called with a table mapping *k*-mers to their return times.
## To compute these return times with maximum performance, first compute the *k*-mer indices using `kmerIndices <#kmerIndices,string,Positive>`_:
## 
## ```nim
## let indices = kmerIndices("ATGACGA...", k)
## ```
## Then, compute the return times using functions such as `sameKmerReturnTimes <#sameKmerReturnTimes,Table[string,seq[T][int]]>`_, `pairwiseKmerReturnTimes <#pairwiseKmerReturnTimes,Table[string,seq[T][int]]>`_ and `reverseComplementReturnTimes <#reverseComplementReturnTimes,Table[string,seq[T][int]]>`_:
## 
## ```nim
## let returnTimes = sameKmerReturnTimes(indices)
## ```
## 
## Then, to compute the metrics for the return time distribution, you can call `returnTimeDistribution <#returnTimeDistribution,Table[string,seq[T][int]]>`_ on the resultant table:
## 
## ```nim
## let rtd = returnTimeDistribution(returnTimes)
## ```
## 
## ## A Note on Degenerate Bases
##
## Degenerate bases (*i.e.* non AUTGC) bases don't have a clearly defined return time distribution since they are ambiguous.
## Therefore, to prevent invalid seqeunces resulting in invalid results, the `kmers <#kmers.i,string,Positive>`_ iterator will raise a `DegenerateBaseError <#DegenerateBaseError>`_ when confronted with a degenerate sequence. 
## 
## ## A Note on Naming
## 
## Nim and Python, although they share nearly identical syntax at the high level, vary signifcantly with respect to naming.
## In Python, `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ states that "function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability."
## Nim *prefers* camelCase, but, importantly, doesn't distinguish between the two due to its definition of `identifier equality <https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#lexical-analysis-identifier-equality>`_.
## Therefore, calling `kmer_indices` in Nim is precisely the same as calling `kmerIndices`.
## Within the Nim implementation, the names are *defined* in Nim-style camel case.
## In the Python API, these names are exported only in the PEP8 style.
## Therefore, the Nim function `kmerIndices` is exported to Python only as `kmer_indices` for Python style compatibility.
