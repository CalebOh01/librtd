This project aims to make DNA and RNA _k_-mer return time distribution analysis simple, fast, and generalizable.

## What is a _k_-mer return time distribution?

Consider the DNA sequences `AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT` and `ATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATATAT`.
Normal _k_-mer frequency based analysis methods would treat these sequences identically.
For _k_=1, the number of `A` 1-mers is precisely equal to the number of `T` 1-mers in both sequences.
However, _k_-mer return time methods ask the following question:
**For a given _k_-mer, how close (in base pairs) is it to the next occurrence of another _k_-mer (usually the same one).**

So, going back to the example above, for _k_=1, the return times the first sequence for `A` would be 1, 1, 1... since each `A` _k_-mer is one base away from the next `A` _k_-mer. For the second sequence, it would be 2, 2, 2... since each `A` is takes two bases to become an `A` again.

In `librtd`, we have generalized the concept of _k_-mer return time to include the distance of a _k_-mer not only to the next occurrence of itself but also to the next occurrence of another _k_-mer. In the first sequence, the return times from `A` to `T` are 17, 16, ..., 2, 1. This is useful for studying the relationship between the location of various pairs of _k_-mers, not just individual _k_-mers.

Once the _k_-mer return times have been calculated, `librtd` can automatically compute the mean and standard deviation of the return times for each _k_-mer, allowing the distribution to be easily summarized.
In the first example, the mean distance between `A` and `T` is 9 with a standard deviation of 5. whereas in the second example, the mean distance is 1 with a standard deviation of 0.

This technique is useful in applications wherever [alignment-free sequence analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment-free_sequence_analysis) is used, from phylogeny to metagenomics.
Give `librtd` a try!
